            all involved. This may require reaching a compromise; however, it is
            key for the cooperation to be successful that every partner obtains
            an added value from it.

            Market-driven incentives (e.g., monetarisation, service provision)
            are important incentives for cooperation. However, it is also
            crucial to explicitly articulate other types of incentives (i.e.,
            organisational and societal) (see Table 15).{" "}
            <span>Societal incentives</span> are at the heart of the DS4SSCCâ€™s
            shared vision and as such need to inform the data cooperation.
